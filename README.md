#Introduction
âž¢ In the current digital landscape, brute force attacks remain one of the most prevalent and dangerous cybersecurity threats. This project, titled "Kubernetes-Splunk-BruteForceDetection-Project", is designed to simulate brute force login attempts in a controlled Kubernetes environment. The goal is to understand and detect how attackers attempt unauthorized access through repeated login attempts and to analyze these suspicious activities in real time using Splunk.

This project includes a Flask-based Secure Login System with Suspicious Activity Detection, built using Python Flask. It offers functionalities like user creation, login simulation, and tracking of abnormal login behavior such as multiple failed attempts. All logs and events are captured and analyzed through Splunk to identify potential brute force activities effectively.
